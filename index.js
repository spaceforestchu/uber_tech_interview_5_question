/*

You are given an array containing 5 integers. The first two integers define the starting and ending points of one range, 
while the next two integers define the starting and ending points of a second range. The last integer in the array is a number, X. 
Your task is to check if the two ranges overlap by at least X numbers. If they do, return true; otherwise, return false.

Example 1:

The ranges are:

5 to 15
8 to 12

These ranges overlap by at least 4 numbers (8, 9, 10, 11), so the result should be true.

Example 2:

Array: [2, 6, 8, 12, 3]

The ranges are:

2 to 6
8 to 12

In this case, there is no overlap between the two ranges (2-6 and 8-12). So, the result should be false.
